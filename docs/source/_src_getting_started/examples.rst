There are several example applications available in `this repository`_, in the form of Python scripts.
At the top of each `.py` example file, the topic and goals of such example application are explained in detail.

In addition, to facilitate the understanding of tudat(py) code, a selection of the example applications are
illustrated in more detail in the pages linked below.
